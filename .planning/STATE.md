## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-planning]: BYOK for LLM — app is free, can't absorb API costs (pending confirmation)
- [Pre-planning]: Hybrid classification — must work without LLM, better with one (pending confirmation)
- [Pre-planning]: Email/password auth for v1 — simplest path, social login deferred (pending confirmation)
- [Pre-planning]: Uptime as indicator only — no alerts or history in v1 (pending confirmation)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use explicit native bindings (@tailwindcss/oxide-darwin-arm64, @rolldown/binding-darwin-arm64) — npm optional deps skip them on arm64 macOS
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Two DB clients: neon-http for serverless API routes, pg Pool (max:5) for worker — pg-boss requires direct connection with session-level advisory locks
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Tags as free-form strings with source field (user/rule/llm) — never enums — preserves Phase 2 classification compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: pg-boss on Neon cold starts — validate that pg-boss works with Neon's scale-to-zero; worker may need a direct (non-HTTP-pooler) connection
- [Phase 2]: Playwright memory on worker host — profile concurrent Playwright sessions on Render paid tier to avoid OOM
- [Phase 5]: BYOK LLM proxy decision — client calls LLM directly vs. server proxies using encrypted key; resolve during Phase 5 planning
